    about: "<p>I'm a Front End Developer and Designer from Toronto, Canada.</p>
			<p>I've spent many years within the digital industry honing my skills as first a Designer, then making the move to Front End Development. Spending 6 years within the entertainment industry, I recently made the move to agency life to grow my skills and production experience.</p>
			<p>I graduated in 2005 from Humber College from the Multimedia Design and Production Technician program - I've been working as a both-sides-of-the-brain creative since, working to strategize, create and execute successful projects. Based out of the west end of Toronto, I currently work with Mosaic as a Front End Developer and devote my free time working on an open source project called <a href='cashmusic.org'>Cash Music</a>.</p>"
